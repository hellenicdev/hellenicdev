Hi there! I’m HellenicDev — an independent developer from Greece who loves building open-source projects, experimenting with web technologies, and turning creative ideas into working software.

##💡 **What I Do**

🧠 Develop interactive web apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

🕹️ Create games and experiments for browsers

🤖 Build small AI-powered tools and assistants

🧰 Explore new frameworks, APIs, and developer tools

###🚀 Featured Project

CoDriver

Written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML

Simple, fast, and designed for browsers

Continuously evolving — new features added regularly

###🌍 Mission
